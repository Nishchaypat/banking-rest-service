# Banking API Roadmap

This is plan for future roadmap

## Phase 1: Strengthen Security & Database (1-3 Days)

First step is to build a rock-solid foundation.

- **Security**: Use Firebase for solid security
- **Database**: Migrate to a powerful database like PostgreSQL and set up automated backups.

## Phase 2: Build a Modern Web App (1 Week)

To create a user-friendly interface.

**Key Features**:
- A dashboard to see account balances and transactions.
- Easy tools for transferring money and managing cards.
- A mobile-first design that works on any device.

## Phase 3: Better Logins with Firebase (1-2 Days)

To improve how users sign in and get notifications.

- **Authentication**: Allow logins with Google, email, and phone, and add multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Emails**: Automate emails for sign-ups, password resets, and transaction alerts.

## Phase 4: Smarter Data Validation (1-2 Days)

To ensure all data is clean and accurate.

- **Goal**: Use advanced checks to prevent errors and invalid financial data from entering our system.

## Phase 5: Move to Microservices (6-12 Days)

To prepare for advance use, it will be better to modernize the architecture.

- **Goal**: Break the application into smaller, independent services (e.g., Accounts, Transactions) to improve scalability and make updates easier.
